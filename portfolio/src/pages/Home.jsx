                    I was born in Bangladesh and moved to the U.S at the age of nine. Ever since I was young, I have been inspired
                    by technology and the impact it has on our daily lives. I am passionate about learning new technologies and how
                    they can be used to solve real-world problems. I like working on solo projects in my free time to improve my skills
                    and become a better developer. I hope that one day I will be able to use my skills to contribute to the tech industry.

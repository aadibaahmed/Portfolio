                <p>Other than programming, I love music, art, and gaming. Some instruments I can play are the violin, piano, and guitar.
                    Ever since I was young, I loved gaming and playing different genres of games. My favorite game is the Xenoblade Chronicles
                    series. I also love FPS games and have played them since I was around seven. I also love art and my primary goal right now
                    is to be able to draw sprites and creat animations for my own personal 2D game. One other thing I love is Winnie The Pooh!
                    I have a collection of the character thatI have been collecting since I was a child.
